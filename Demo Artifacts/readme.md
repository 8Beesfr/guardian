[IREC](https://github.com/hashgraph/guardian/tree/main/Demo%20Artifacts/iREC)

**Description**: 

This policy supports the tokenization of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in accordance with the I-REC Standard, and specifically, the I-REC(E) Product Code. The I-REC Standard is a non-profit organization that provides an attribute tracking standard that can be used around the world. While the I-REC Standard is designed to track attributes for a diversity of products, Product Codes provide additional requitements for specific products and markets. The I-REC(E) Product Code provides requirements for electricity products, and was developed by Evident, who acts as Code Manager and Registry Operator. The schema and workflow of this policy were designed to reflect the MRV requirements, processes, and roles outlined by both I-REC Standard and the I-REC(E) Product Code.
