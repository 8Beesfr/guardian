We have two options to create Policy :&#x20;

1. Creating Policy from scratch
2. Importing Policy either from file or from IPFS.

### 1. Creating Policy from Scratch

1.1 To create Policy from scratch, we need to click on "Create Policy" button.

1.2 Once you click on Create Policy , you get a dialog box to fill out basic Policy details.

1.3 Once the details are filled and clicked on OK. Initially, Policy is created in Draft status.

1.5 When clicked on Edit, the screen is navigated to Policies configuration tab, which gives an option to add/remove any block from the Policy.

### 2. Importing Policy either from File or from IPFS

Instead of creating Policy from scratch, there is an option of importing the Policy zip file from Local system.

2.1 Once the .zip file is selected, we get the Policy Import Review screen. Once everything looks good, click on Import Button.

2.2 The Policy can also be imported by importing it from IPFS.

2.3 To do this, you can use the sample policy that we have already uploaded to IPFS by entering the Hedera Message IDs.

```
1655293847.166673000 (new iREC Policy)
```
