# Guardian Introduction

The Guardian is an open-source tool that leverages the Hedera public distributed ledger network to mint emissions and carbon offset tokens. It provides auditable, traceable, reproducible records that document the emission process and lifecycle of carbon credits, which reduce fraud in the ESG market.
