# Discovering ESG assets on Hedera

As identified in Hedera Improvement Proposal 19 (HIP-19), each entity on the Hedera network may contain a specific identifier in the memo field for discoverability. Guardian demonstrates this when every Hedera Consensus Service transaction is logged to a Hedera Consensus Service Topic. Observing the Hedera Consensus Service Topic, you can discover newly minted tokens. In the memo field of newly minted tokens, you will find a [Verifiable Link](https://github.com/InterWorkAlliance/Sustainability/blob/main/vem/supply/verification.md) which will allow users to discover the published standard the token is following and the entire history of the ESG asset and corresponding data to be publicly discoverable. This is further defined in [Hedera Improvement Proposal 28 (HIP-28)](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-28).
